        "description": "<p>In 2016, CLIR funded a Hidden Collections grant which would eventually digitize and make available 475 codex manuscripts and many hundreds of fragments from 15 institutions in and around Philadelphia. That project, Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis, colloquially known as BiblioPhilly, has been a resounding success, succeeding in bringing attention to the incredible premodern manuscript collections of the City of Brotherly Love and also inspiring other digitization projects, including the current CLIR-funded Peripheral Manuscripts Project.</p><p>In their talk, BiblioPhilly PI Lois Black and co-PI Dot Porter will discuss the afterlife of BiblioPhilly focusing on student work that has been generated by the availability of the digitized manuscripts. Manuscripts included in BiblioPhilly inspired the work of a new population of student researchers at Lehigh University from a myriad of disciplines. Data contained in astronomical manuscripts sparked the curiosity of a physics major and led to his overcoming linguistic and paleographical hurdles. Musical notes represented in a medieval choir book led an engineering student to research life in monasteries and musical performance of the period.</p>"

        "description": "<p>In 2017 through the generous funding of CLIR's Digitizing Hidden Collections grant program the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Archives digitized videotapes held in the Deaf Studies, Culture, and History Archives (DSA). These rare videotapes document the ASL literature movement in Rochester from 1970 to 2011 and represent the largest collection of ASL literature to be made broadly accessible. The once “hidden” work of a pioneering and under-represented group is now public, broadening access to the cultural heritage of this diverse group little known outside of the Deaf community and enriching interdisciplinary studies in linguistics, poetry, performing arts, and cinema.</p><p>The DSA was established to ensure that the cultural heritage and lives of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) and connected Deaf, DeafBlind, DeafDisabled, and hard of hearing communities are preserved. The DSA collects materials that will increase knowledge of the history and culture of NTID and connected Deaf community members, and strengthen identity formation and pride. NTID, one of nine colleges within RIT, played a leading role in the history of the ASL poetry movement in the United States, hosting national conferences on ASL Literature attended by Deaf and hearing scholars, students, interpreters, and the public.</p><p>The videotapes capture performances by Deaf poets such as Robert Panara, Clayton Valli, Debbie Rennie, Peter Cook, Ella Mae Lentz, and others performing and analyzing ASL literature works at national conferences, in the classroom, and on stage. Each poet has a unique sign language expressive style, which range from Panara's transliteration of traditional English works and Shakespeare into contact sign with ASL features, to the avant-garde ASL and spoken English hybrid work of the Deaf and hearing ‘Flying Words' duo Cook and Lerner, to Valli's (the Deaf “Robert Frost”) original poetry created solely in ASL that uses body language, rhythm, movement and spatial expression.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that adding closed captions and transcripts to videos increase search traffic, page views, search rank, and engagement for all audiences. More than 80% of hearing students as well as Deaf students use captions and transcripts as study aids, enabling them to stay focused, and learn at their own pace which result in higher GPAs, increased comprehension, and retention of content. Making this type of video content truly accessible creates additional expenses. In the case of the videotapes in question, with their unique subject matter and mix of voicing and signing, the difficulties and labor required are compounded.</p><p>Panelists will discuss the project from their individual vantage points and roles – a curator and member of the Deaf community, an archivist, and a department administrator. Discussion will center around what goes into making cultural heritage truly accessible; creating best practices that also allow for adoption of sustainable work flow models; and the tension that exists between following best practices and striving to create sustainable work flows and the reality of the labor intensiveness of it all.</p>",

        "author": "Hilary Schroeder, Lydia See, Whitney Richardson, Corey Loftus",
        "description": "<p>In 2017, the Asheville Art Museum received 405 documents from the family of Theodore Dreier, a cofounder of Black Mountain College (BMC). Consisting of course catalogs, community bulletins, event programs, letters, essays, and other printed matter personally collected by Dreier while at and following his departure from the college, the scope of materials relates to individuals and events represented within and beyond the Museum's Collection of BMC artworks. In 2019, the Museum began an intensive period of engagement with the documents after years of registrarial limbo, made possible by support from CLIR's Digitizing Hidden Collections grant. This process included reorganization of materials, cataloging and digitization, and critical investigation into the documents' presence within an art museum collection. Processing this collection has been undertaken by curatorial staff, graduate fellows, and interns and has generated compelling examples of how documents enhance exhibitions and object interpretation. This paper explores several projects from the past several years that are precedent for future pursuits. Engagement with the Dreier documents resulted in both physical exhibitions and the development of digital exhibitions and web-based content soon to be available on the CLIR-supported BMC Interconnective Timeline. The documents foster greater interdisciplinarity within exhibitions and programming, bringing audiences into conversations that delve into diversity, design, intersections of media, and ideological impacts that extend the Black Mountain College legacy to the present. These explorations underscore the value of these materials to scholars and visitors and set in motion their continued use as interpretive tools in myriad settings physically and digitally.</p>",

Among the goals of the program revision were to diversify the applicant pool, to expand support for less-frequent-grant-seeking organizations, and to shift support toward the digitization of collections that increase the presence of underrepresented stories within the digital historical record. We will outline our work, concurrent with the program's first year of implementation, to assess the program's revision and implementation, which included interviews with applicants at various stages in the process, grantees, program staff, and a topical and content analysis of the aggregate of applications received. We will discuss the degree to which DHC:AUV reached its goals, outline observations for various areas of the program from applicant support to application review to program equity, and offer insights for applicants to similar grant programs.</p>",

We propose a 45-minute DIY session for members of the Deaf Catholic Archives team, each using 10- to 15-minute segments, to introduce this hidden collection and describe prioritized areas of consideration as the project gets underway. These areas include the development of workflows to address such complex issues as content selection, privacy concerns, and permissions, while mindfully incorporating the nuances of Deaf culture in all processes.</p><p>A priority of our project design is configuring workflows to identify and obtain permissions in order to make materials publically available after digitization. The collection includes over 200 newsletters, with copyright holders varying from international organizations to individual church parishes. Another priority is to identify and manage personally identifiable information contained in items selected for digitization, including birthdays, emails, and mailing addresses. Since this collection documents how Deaf Catholics practice their faith, personal stories are found throughout and those privacy concerns must be addressed as well. Workflows will be developed to review materials before being made public in our digital repository. A takedown policy will be established to address any privacy concerns after the project is completed.</p><p>Throughout this project, we strive to be mindful and inclusive of the Deaf community as we work with materials outside our knowledge base. In particular, we seek the community's input for description and metadata and how to address offensive or outdated terminology, especially as part of the collection's web presence.</p><p>Our presentation will address several topic areas listed in the call for proposals, including using digitized collections to amplify unheard voices; exploring the meanings of “hidden” and “accessible” across collecting contexts and populations served; addressing complex rights and ethical issues related to digitized collections; and building and maintaining equitable, authentic partnerships for digitization.</p>",

None of the Library's materials were meaningfully described or discoverable in the OPAC. The grant was transformative, increasing awareness of and use by subject experts. But the Free Library is a public library, and its priority is Philadelphians. Philadelphia has a lot of Muslims, the majority of whom are Black and native to the city.</p><p>“It's digitized, what's next” became the community-led In the Path of Islam. We wanted to build relationships with people who mostly felt indifferent about the Library and with library branches around the city who mostly felt indifferent about the Rare Book Department. Reflecting, the project included a lot of what we expected (hard trust-building, dancing for dollars) and a lot which we didn't (COVID, tense meetings). In the Path of Islam is a successor project to Manuscripts of the Muslim World: a team effort, funded by grants. But In the Path of Islam was both more rewarding and incalculably more challenging that the CLIR grant that laid its foundation.</p><p>Now, I'm ruminating on touchy questions. If a user community is underrepresented in an institution, the institution can't Field of Dreams its way to engagement. But what about when that same institution, cash-strapped and short-staffed, doesn't care about building it in the first place? What do we mean by “underrepresented community” when no community is a monolith? And how can we keep our institutions out of our way?</p>",

        "description": "<p>Through our CLIR Digitizing Hidden Collections grant Science and Survival: Digitizing the Papers of Georg and Max Bredig (awarded 2020), the Science History Institute is bringing an important archive to multiple digital audiences. The Bredig Papers are an intimate family collection that cover Georg Bredig's scientific training under the founders of physical chemistry, followed swiftly by his forced retirement and the demise of his career and very way of life under the Third Reich. Today, local communities across the US are curious about their heritage and the challenges faced by their immigrant parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Scientific networks were often used to negotiate escape routes for those fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe, making the Bredig collection of interest to both scholarly and public audiences.</p><p>Yet while processing and digitizing collections is often sufficient for scholarly audiences, our Google Analytics and end-user interviews taught us that public audiences need more. Additional resources must be invested in transcribing archaic handwriting, translating foreign languages into English, and interpreting the large body of historical content into a digestible narrative story. This paper explores how we gathered data about our target audiences and what strategic decisions we made upon analyzing them. We will discuss hiring a professional translator, building a custom UI for viewing transcriptions and translations, as well as creating online magazine articles, public programming, and collaborations with both local and European community groups. We seek to answer the question “we digitized it – what's next?” by showing that such projects shouldn't end with digitization.</p>",

The collection is made up of 87 hours of film related to voter registration and civil rights organizing in Natchez, Mississippi in 1965 and 1967. The Ed Pincus Film Collection digital exhibition launched in the Louisiana Digital Library in December 2021, but Amistad's work with the collection has not ended. This panel presentation will allow Amistad's archivists to discuss their work with the collection, focusing on its ongoing preservation and how the collection has been accessed and used by the public since its digitization.</p><p>Work with the Pincus collection has been a cross-departmental effort. Brenda Flora, curator of Moving Images and Recorded Sound, and Phillip Cunningham, head of References Services, along with Director of Archives Division Laura Thomson, will talk about the team effort to ensure the digital longevity and accessibility of the collection. The challenges faced during the course of the project have helped the interdepartmental team to form a new approach to digital asset management within the institution and to strengthen its digital preservation infrastructure across collections.</p><p>Archivists will also share some of the more exciting outcomes of the project, including ways that the digital accessibility of the films has opened the collection to researchers and audiences, facilitating new connections to members of the Natchez community and providing the basis for a new documentary incorporating the outtake footage to tell a story that was previously unheard.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The CLIR grant project entitled Early State Records for 26 US States and Territories West of the Appalachians: a Digital Record from European Contact to Early Statehood Based on the Library of Congress' Microfilm Collection epitomizes the significance of content once “hidden” and now enhanced. We cannot claim to have had a crystal ball to predict the relevance of this content during the past few years, whether it's the make-up of the US Supreme Court, with the corresponding emphasis on originalism; the Black Lives Matter movement and the heightened consciousness of Black history; the constitutional debates and what will be taught as lessons from the past at all levels of education; and/or the support for Indigenous peoples and other marginalized communities and their history and civil rights. Current events and emphasis on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion make this archival treasure trove vital to researchers and society as a whole.</p><p>Illustrations of the meanings of <em>hidden</em> and <em>accessible</em> to be covered by the panel of bibliographic experts and legal professionals include:</p><ul><li>Multifaceted bibliographic, editorial, and production effort – Early State Records on microfilm was a hostile resource: few libraries owned the entire collection; state content was dispersed on other states' reels; published Index headings were too general and often inaccurate; volumes within a title were separated; etc. LLMC and Saint Louis University legal experts contributed significantly to the discoverability of Early State Records. By reengineering our production and editorial workflow, we evaluated every document (840,000 images) on 506 reels of microfilm to inform proper handling. All 2,679 titles received quality citations and invaluable abstracts, addressing research challenges such as languages, handwriting legibility, fire damage to originals, etc. Future plans for enhanced access include transcribing the full text of manuscripts.</li><li>Incredible response from the user community – Once the content started appearing online, it quickly became the most heavily searched collection on LLMC Digital and LLMC Open Access, proving not everything of value has yet been responsibly digitized! Responses following webinars covering this material are impressive as well. For example, NYLI (New York Law Institute), which provides quarterly webinars covering this content for its many attorney members, was the second heaviest user of LLMC Digital in 2021.</li><li>Significance of the formerly “hidden” content itself – Optimized digital access to this incredible collection brings to the forefront information which exceeds expectations. Legal experts have already exposed insight from this noteworthy content in presentations, blogs, and other communications. For instance, several expert blogs written by Professor Joyce Savio Herleth, Saint Louis University School of Law, shed light on the range and relevance of these instructive documents, focusing on timely subjects such as: women's rights; influences of Indigenous and foreign countries on our history; responses to global pandemics of the past such as smallpox; materials which illustrate Black history; and experiences predicated on religion. The list for topics in future communications and educational programs are limitless.</li></ul>",

        "description": "<p>The Virginia Tech Insect Collection (VTEC), founded in 1888, is the oldest and largest entomological collection in Virginia and a historical collection representing Appalachia's insect biodiversity. Its more than half-million specimens represent the rich diversity of the eastern United States. VTEC is an exceptional repository of pollinators, endangered and native species, once common but now disappearing due to habitat loss. VTEC was underfunded and hidden from view since discontinuation of state support in 1992. Revitalization began in 2015 with a National Science Foundation grant to fund conservation infrastructure and stabilization through storage upgrades and preliminary digitization for approximately 3 percent of its holdings. Since VTEC is too large to digitize within the scope of a single Hidden Collections grant, our project focuses on comprehensive digitization of ecologically and economically critical native pollinators and endangered and threatened species native to Appalachia. This two-year project digitizes, describes, and provides access to 15,000 pinned insect specimens through high resolution photos and 400 high resolution 3D models.</p><p>The specialized technical skills necessary for the 3D modeling in this project come from students in the Creative Technologies program in the Virginia Tech School of Visual Arts. This program trains students in 3D modeling as it is taught in video game design. Graduate students were solicited through a stipend (paid by the grant) and full tuition (paid by the library and the School of Visual Arts) for a graduate degree to qualified applicants. Undergraduate students were also hired as wage employees for production. Students are engaged in technology processes throughout the project and learn complex curatorial tasks, digitization protocols, catalog structure, technical metadata, and documentation. Participation provided the students with a professional portfolio to help them in their search for future employment.</p><p>This project also presented the University Libraries' digital library development, digital imaging, and preservation teams with new technical challenges that are unique across the spectrum of academic libraries. In the absence of firmly established best practices for managing 3D data across disciplines, we developed a technical plan adopted from established reference models such as OAIS, and based on research stemming from the IMLS funded 2018 LIB3DVR project. Entomo-3D presents a real-world test of our findings</p><p>In navigating the challenges of the past few years, the students who contributed to the project helped increase capacity at Virginia Tech for future large scale 3D projects and have also developed a unique and marketable set of skills and experiences.</p>",

This collection contains the earliest documentation of Nashville, Tennessee's oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU). This paper will explore the development of one of America's first archives for African and African American history and culture, beginning in 1929 with bibliophile Arturo Schomburg and librarian Louis Shores. Through their visionary work, the Fiskiana Collection developed to capture the vital legacy of Fisk University. Now, over 150 years later, the work begins to grasp the publications of this significant collection through digitization and metadata creation. This undertaking is no small feat for a small academic library that serves a population of 1,000 students. This project has provided us with an opportunity to be visionaries, developing models that look toward future digitization projects while simultaneously incorporating standards of practice that support our organization's resources and capabilities. We recognize the uniqueness of the selected materials to be digitized and the importance of describing and communicating the importance of HBCU publications. The immediate necessity is to support a network of institutions whose sole purpose for decades was to build and support African American life, culture, and history.

These records tell an important story about the distribution of land and social and legal justice in California following statehood in 1850, when all Spanish and Mexican land grants holders were required to prove their land claims in court. A lengthy process of litigation followed, which resulted in many early Californians losing their land. The Land Case Files are heavily used by current land owners, genealogists, historians, and environmentalists to understand the land, its uses, and ownership over time.</p><p>The digitization project, Land, Wealth and Power: Private Land Claim Cases in California 1852 to 1892 (Mary Elings, principal investigator) was awarded a 2019 Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant. We launched the project amid pandemic restrictions and limited on-site work hours. The materials had to be carefully inspected for special handling and digital capture conditions, and many of the materials required conservation to ensure they could be safely digitized. When complete, this project will significantly improve researcher access to the collection online. With over 90 percent of the documents handwritten, the Bancroft is also exploring community engagement strategies to transcribe and translate the records to extract the full text of these documents to unlock even greater research potential, particularly in areas of digital scholarship.</p>",

        "author": "Karen Cariani, Michael Kamins, David Saiz, Torin Andersen, Miranda Villesvik, Casey Davis Kaufman",
        "description": "<p>The American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between the Library of Congress and GBH, has created innovative partnerships with a variety of public media organizations and archives on CLIR grants to digitize, preserve, and make accessible via the AAPB tens of thousands of hours of historic and endangered programming created for public television and radio. From national series such as the PBS NewsHour and its predecessors and local stations such as KVZK in Pago Pago, American Samoa, KUT in Austin, KERA in Dallas, and the WRVR collection at the Riverside Church in the City of New York, to statewide consortia in New Mexico and Kansas, the AAPB team and its collaborators have developed strategies and distributed workflows for large-scale audiovisual digitization projects, preservation, access, and engagement – learning lots along the way.</p><p>Panelists representing the AAPB and some of the projects mentioned will share insights on funding and budgets; building and maintaining equitable partnerships; organizing statewide digitization projects; working with vendors; adapting projects during a pandemic; getting buy-in from rural, often under resourced station partners; countering dominant narratives and amplifying unheard voices through online exhibitions of digitized collections; collaborative quality control; copyright review for online access; and community-centered engagement via crowdsourcing transcription and Wikipedia Edit-a-thons. The panelists will also share insights on the need for more funding to support public media preservation.</p>"

        "title": "Preserving the Video Record with the Guerrilla Television Network",
        "author": "Dan Erdman, Sara Chapman, Adam Hart, Cecilia Smith",
        "description": "<p>In the late 1960s, the first portable video cameras came on the market. For the next decade, artists, activists, and community groups found unprecedented freedom to create works of media art and journalism with this new technology. The era marked an explosion of footage produced by groups who traditionally had not had access to the tools of video or television production, including BIPOC, women, people with low income, rural communities, and the disabled.</p><p>But now, the very technology that enabled this flourishing of voices may potentially silence them. Obsolescence, lack of playback equipment, and deterioration of now half-century-old videotape threatens to render these images permanently inaccessible, as though they had never existed. Thus, community-based videotape from the 1960s and 1970s currently languishes in a sort of media history limbo, stuck in a self-reinforcing spiral: nobody can see the footage, so nobody knows about the footage, so nobody advocates for its preservation, so nobody can see the footage….</p><p>With the Resurrecting the 1970s Guerrilla Television Movement project, a group of media art centers and archives – led by Media Burn Archive and the University of Chicago – seeks to change that. This bold project will digitize thousands of tapes from this era and then stream these works on the Guerrilla Television Network, a new web portal dedicated exclusively to this material. The presentation will focus on the challenges specific to preserving and creating access to this footage and the ways in which media scholarship will change in this project's wake.</p>",

        "title": "Revealing Visual Culture: Enhancing Metadata to Increase Image Discovery",
        "author": "Skye Lacerte, Andrea Degener",
        "description": "<p>The Revealing Visual Culture project created digital images and high-level metadata for 150,000 modern periodical illustration tear sheets contained in the Walt Reed Illustration Archive at Washington University Libraries. The collection is a wealth of data: the tear sheets illuminate stylistic trends of commercial illustration over five decades, images that depict cultural norms and stereotypes, a wide breadth of artists both famous and unknown, pages of both fiction and nonfiction text from multiple genres of periodicals, and advertisements for both common and obscure products.</p><p>Digitization began in January 2016 and continued through 2018. As the files were produced, administrative metadata was added to the collection and it was published in its entirety as a public collection in Artstor/JSTOR Forum. Work has been ongoing to enhance the descriptive metadata of over 150,000 individual assets. Because a full-time position was not created for this project, this work has been done by numerous student workers and staff. The collection is so large that it sustained work-from-home projects for a number of staff for months during the pandemic. However, as of today, only 30,000 records contain fully descriptive data. Enhancing the metadata for the assets is crucial for research and discovery. In this presentation, the project's principal investigator and visual materials archivist will discuss the challenges and successes of the project, as well as the innovative systems created to enhance image records and increase accessibility.</p>"

        "title": "Cleared for Takeoff: Digitizing the “World's Most Experienced Airline” and Creation of a Navigation Portal in DPLA",
        "author": "Gabriella Williams, Jacqueline Wachholz, Leah Tams, Scott Williams, Adriana J. Millaries",
        "description": "<p>The creation and launch of a subject-based portal, Cleared for Takeoff: Explore Commercial Aviation, which features Pan American World Airways materials digitized from collections at the University of Miami, HistoryMiami Museum, and Duke University, alongside commercial aviation resources from the Digital Public Library of America's (DPLA) partner network, provides an important tool for researchers. The portal aims to enable students, teachers, scholars, and other researchers to easily discover and build connections across aviation collections nationwide. It includes an interactive Pan Am timeline exhibition, as well as a primary source set (PSS) and classroom lesson plan for instructors. The records, advertisements, and artifacts which were digitized and the primary sources that were carefully curated demonstrate the profound and ubiquitous impact Pan Am had on the world and its substantial influence on globalization and modernization. Issues such as feminism and gender roles, diversity and racism, colonialism and environmentalism are among some of the overarching themes that have been fleshed out through this project. In 2018, these four institutions were awarded a Digitizing Hidden Collections grant from CLIR to gain exposure to these important collections and contextualize them alongside other important commercial aviation records from other institutions nationwide. The grant partners will discuss the challenges of creating such an innovative research tool, lessons learned, and explore potential avenues for future sustainability of the project.</p>",

        "title": "Southern Roots of American Judaism: Shedding Light through Digitization",
        "author": "Leah Worthington, Tyler Mobley, Meaghan Cash, Brenna Reilley",
        "description": "<p>Despite Charleston, South Carolina being one of the most important early Jewish American cities, few of the 8-10 million tourists who visit Charleston each year see this history reflected in historical tourism and at public history sites. Even most scholars of Charleston omit the history of Jews. Only recently have scholars taken on the mantle of narrating the Jewish experience in the American South. Our panel will discuss how digitizing thousands of archival items and using inclusive descriptive metadata 1) amplifies the largely unknown history of Jewish Charleston and 2) highlights the connections between Jewish Charleston and broader historical narratives, including race relations in Charleston, Southern women's identity, and white Southern identity during and after the American Civil War. In this way, the project connects the city's hidden, underrepresented, and dominate voices to each other. We will also discuss the project's public and scholarly outreach taking form as a digital public history exhibit and lectures. By not only digitizing and creating metadata but including plans for interpretation (an exhibit and lectures), these hidden collections will garner interest from scholars, student researchers, local community members, and the public, including tourists. Our panelists are project team members with a wide range of roles in the project and experience levels. The project's metadata and research assistant, Meaghan Cash, is an early career librarian who will speak about writing inclusive descriptive metadata and how to use metadata to optimize discoverability; with newly gained skills like collection uploading in ResourceSpace, writing MODS metadata, and assisting a scholar with research, she will also speak to how this work is preparing her for future positions in the field. Our technical director, Tyler Mobley, is instrumental in planning the websites where collections and exhibits are displayed; he can also speak to how he has built these interconnected websites with sustainable, long-term preservation as a central goal. He will also speak to how the metadata and digital collections produced by this project will start in the Lowcountry Digital Library, but then also be harvested into state (South Carolina Digital library) and national (Digital Public Library of America) digital libraries. Leah Worthington, the digital projects manager, facilitates the partnerships, trainings, and daily project operations required for a project with interdisciplinary deliverables; she will speak to how she has harnessed digital library and digital history tools to share collections and interpret them for the public and prepare graduate students and early career librarians for future careers—from MODS metadata and collection uploading training to image research, copyright assessment, and exhibition layout training. Brenna Reilley, a Public History graduate assistant, will be able to speak to how the skills she has learned as a student—image research, drafting exhibit layout, using Omeka, and creating social media connect—are preparing her for a future career in her field. The panel is designed to include people who can speak to all aspects of how the project used digitization, robust metadata, and sustainable, duplicatable processes to unveiled hidden collections.</p>"
